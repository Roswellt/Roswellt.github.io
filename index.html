    <p>Hi, my name is Quang-Tri and I am a student at the University of Ottawa studying Software Engineering. My passion for programming started when
      I first learned about the foundations of coding such as the program structure and conditionals. I find creating solutions to problems using these
      concepts incredibly fulfilling and interesting. I have a strong desire to improve my programming and motivated to learn as much as I can.
      In my spare time I like working on android applications, reading or just learning how to improve my coding.
